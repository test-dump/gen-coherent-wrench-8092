Here is a basic example of a "Hello, World!" console app in C#:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```
This program writes the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console window. When you run this program, you would see output like this:

```
Hello, World!
```

This is the simplest kind of C# program that you can write. It's typically used as a beginner's first program.
