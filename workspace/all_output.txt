Example steps for running the program:

1. Start Visual Studio.
2. On the menu bar, choose `File` > `New` > `Project`.
3. In the new project dialog box, select `Console Application` under `Visual C#`.
4. Name the project "HelloWorld" and then click `OK`.

In the `Program.cs` file, replace the existing code with the following code:

   ```csharp
   using System;

   namespace HelloWorld
   {
       class Program
       {
           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   
5. Press `F5` or click `Start` on the menu to run the program.
6. You would see the output in the console:
   
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

For tests, as this is a simple hello world program, there are not any elaborate tests you can write. However, you can still make sure the program runs without any errors or exceptions. 

Please note, these instructions are applicable for Visual Studio. If you are using different IDE / text editor or command line, steps might differ slightly. Make sure to refer to respective official documentation for accurate instructions.
